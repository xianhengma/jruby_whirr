# JrubyWhirr

Jruby Whirr is a gem that provides Apache Whirr. Whirr is a library for running services like Hadoop or ZooKeeper in the cloud.

Whirr provides:

   - A cloud-neutral way to run services. You don't have to worry about the idiosyncrasies of each provider. 
   - A common service API. The details of provisioning are particular to the service.
   - Smart defaults for services. You can get a properly configured system running quickly, while still being able to override settings as needed.
